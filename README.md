# Calculator using Bitwise Operators

This is a simple calculator program written in C that performs basic mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) using bitwise operators. The program takes two numbers as input from the user and displays the result of the operation. Error handling is included for division by zero.

## How to use
1. Clone this repository or download the source code.
2. Compile the code using a C compiler.
3. Run the executable file.
4. Enter two numbers and select the operation you want to perform.

### Supported operations
- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (-)
- Multiplication (*)
- Division (/)

## Why bitwise operators?
Bitwise operators are faster than traditional arithmetic operations and can be used to perform basic mathematical operations. This can lead to increased efficiency in certain applications.
